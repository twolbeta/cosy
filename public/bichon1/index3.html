  <title>Without Hesitation This Man Decided To Put His Car Up For Sale To Save His Bichon Frise<title>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would you do if your puppy would be in danger or in a very critical situation and needs expensive surgical intervention in order to be saved? I know that you would not think twice and would do everything possible to save the life of your furry friend. Our pets are our friends, brothers, children and more in a single being that gives us a lot of love. Many of us are willing to make great sacrifices in order to provide their well-being. It also happened with Josep, who put his vehicle up for sale in order to save his bichon frise.
